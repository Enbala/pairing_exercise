# Enbala Interview Pairing Exercise

This exercise was developed to use for interviewing potential Elixir developers
to join us here at Enbala. We've tried to model the exercise based on the sorts
of problems you'll be solving here at Enbala so that maybe through the process,
you could determine if these sound like exciting problems to work on.

There's no particular right answer to the exercise. We're mostly wanting to
facilitate a conversation around how you think about and solve problems using
software. Here are some of the criteria we'll be evaluating you against:

1. Would it be fun to pair with you day to day?
2. How proficient in Elixir are you currently?
3. How well do you manage complexity?
4. How good are you at recognizing and communicating tradeoffs?

Feel free to google stuff, check reference docs, or ask for help along the way.
Also, don't feel any pressure to finish the exercise. We'll get to whereever
we get to, and that's perfectly fine.

The project doesn't ship with any additional dependencies, feel free to add any
that you like.

To run the tests you can just run

```elixir
mix test
```

or to run a particular file you can run

```elixir
mix test test/battery_test.exs
```
